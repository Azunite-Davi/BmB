    # {u}{b}Miq in classroom talking about his final thesis{/b}{/u}
    # ..."

    "Michael" "Can you shut your damn pen and mouth noises? For god’s sake..."

    "I wanted to shove my fist down that asshole’s throat. Last semester he was responsible for making sure my academic life was threefold worse than it already was. Prof. Liam was my living nightmare."

    "Prof. Liam, our 48 years old sociology professor, known as the mood killer for the mild ableist comments he makes. Once he went on a tangent about how kids {i}become {/i}autistic by playing on cell phones..."

    "{i}Ugh gross{/i}."

    "Prof. Liam stared over the rim of his glasses for my test,creeping over onto another student’s desk."

    "Prof. Liam" "Tsk tsk."

    "Not the first time he does this, this tapping, and tongue clicking in his hard palate."

    "He made his way back to the table and pulled out his cell phone; the constant reminder of the passage of time was unnerving and I needed to finish just in time to hang out with Robert."

    "Dan, the pen-tapping student one desk behind me, finished his test and ran into the halls without saying a single word."

    "Tick and tock filled the room, at times it faltered going either too fast or not at all, but today its pointers rested, and when it came to a halt. Prof. Liam, clicked his tongue, and retrieved the clock."

    "Prof. Liam" "Battery\'s dead. Anyway, 15 minutes left to finish the retest, you guys are really lucky they even let me do this kind of stuff."

    "{i}15 minutes is not enough.{/i}"
    
    "I’ve been mulling over these questions for hours, they’re either too advanced for me or they all lead to weird loopholes with odd results."

    "{i}Maybe if you had studied the other day...{/i}"

    "No time to blame myself, I had to finish this, even if it meant-"

    "Prof. Liam" "5 minutes left."

    "{i}What​?! No!{/i}"
   
    "Fuck, all I wanted was to get out of here."

    "I turned in my finished retake test, while Prof. Liam was texting on his phone."

    "I wasn’t exactly happy with the results; my paws were sore and my brain was mashed potatoes. Still, Robert wanted to talk about what he found in the university archives."

    "Robert" "Michael, oi Michael!"

    "Micheal" "Rob! Ya doing alright here mate?"

    "Robert" "Yeah, I mean, I think I found something for your final thesis."

    "Michael" "What might that be?"

    "Robert" "Here, take a look fer yerself."

    "Michael" "Ok? What’s so interesting about this?"
    
    "Well, it\'s a map from the 90s, look how humble our countryside is, but there’s a catch. See this town? {i}Aureliopolis{/i}, it’s completely off the grid and has been like that for the past 53 years or so."

    "Michael" "Ok, what gives? Just old stuff we already know of. Besides, what kind of {i}off the grid {/i}are we talking about?"

    "Robert" "The kind that still uses radios. Of course some computers and probably access to the internet, but that seems to be limited. The entire town seems to be stuck in time."

    "Michael" "That doesn’t mean anything, they can still check the internet just fine."

    "Robert" "You\'re missing the point. Let me explain. The mere fact the city has been completely off the grid for so many years makes it a perfect case to study traditions that have been fossilized and even linguistic data."

    "Michael" "Ok, I’m following. But if that’s so, why haven’t they modernized already?"

    "Robert" "Population seemed extremely resistant to modernization. I reckon they might even reject modern medicine. But folks say they live happier this way."

    "Robert" "Anyway, I suggest we investigate this further, and you can even make a dissertation out of it."

    "Michael" "What, a {i}dissertation{/i}? That would require me to interview folks."

    "Robert" "Exactly, and by that, you could write on how technology has ruined the youth and returning to ‘ye olde times’ is far better."

    "Michael" "That sounds promising I guess... But still, why would I go out of my way to do this? Just fun?"

    "Robert" "Your final thesis, Michael, come on, you never shut about it."

    "Michael" "Oh yeah, my final thesis... Ok, you convinced me. Up until now I didn’t have a topic so far."

    "Robert" "What? Michael! We’re almost graduating, how come you didn’t have a topic by now? What have you been doing this entire time?"

    "Michael" "Uhhh, busy? Because I failed in his classes {i}twice{/i}, no way that old grump is going to hand us university stuff."

    "Robert" "Ok, you got a point, but still, you should’ve done that earlier... But now I’ve basically handed your final thesis on a silver plate."

    "Michael" "Pretty much. But I have an idea, while I go to Aureliopolis and do field research you could... Do some kind of research of what happened with other villas that didn’t survive and compare both cases. I dunno man, there’s so much to talk about."

    "Robert" "Hmmm, yeah sounds reasonable, but you owe me one."

    "Michael" "Right. By the way, where is Aureliopolis?"

    "Robert" "Goiás, some nine hours."

    "Michael" "What. Are you tryin’ to bankrupt me?"

    "Robert" "Gosh you’re so worried about money. Ok, here I’ll lend you some cash."

    "Michael" "Yeah, and? It’s my diploma {i}and{/i} my wallet that’s on the chopping table!"

    "Robert" "Jeez, ok, ok, simmer down. I’m gonna make do for you."

    "Robert" "Anyway, I gotta be off, see ya nerd."

    "Michael" "Bye, see ya around."

    "A nine hour trip to a ruined city, what could go wrong? Besides, I could stand to spend some time away from campus. {i} {/i}"

    # "{u}{b}Transition to Erin’s night b4 dream{/b}{/u}"

    "Many baroque houses painted the mainstreet to which mine stood out as with a porch. While during the day the scenery would attract tourists, now dark corners revealed the ghosts from yore."

    "I slumped, reeking of sleep, sensing shadows pass through corners and alleywalks. Some houses were ready to go until dawn, others were already ready for bed."

    "The front door steps were the first big obstacle in my journey to the bed, one foot and then another, I entered and locked the front door behind me."

    "I thought about taking a shower, but tiredness overtook me, and so the sweet cuddles of my pillows were stronger and I didn’t care if I stink of labor as long as I dreamed."

    "Muscles limp and eyes strained, a stinging sensation across my skull worsened my condition, I could barely stay on one foot. I knew nightmares always followed those long and tedious days at work."

    "When you’re asleep or beginning that journey onto your own subconscious for a night, it almost feels like time is a meaningless measure to which the awake gorge on just to run late."

    "First, strange shapes, growing circles of light then fading away, giving space to more colorful visages, then I felt my left eyelid spasm and restless legs. But once all sense was reduced and I breathed automatically. The bed hugged me."

    "..."

    # "{u}{b}1st Dream sequence{/b}{/u}"

    "Autumn leaves carried by the menace of winter painted the landscape and obscured the lake where I knelt down by the shore." 

    "I stretched my paws towards the lagoon, my brown fur coloration-"

    "{i}Wait, I don’t have brown fur...{/i}"

    "{i}I never had brown fur... Have I? {/i}"

    "There stood someone rather slim and low in stature just behind me, he casted a shadow over me."

    "I was tempted to not look at him because mom told me never to speak to strangers."

    "???" "Hey, you’re not gonna play with us?"

    "{i}That voice... I heard it that day, but what was Nemmi doing here?{/i}"

    "???" "Hellooo, are you even listening?"

    "I jumped to face him. But, Nemmi was older than me, his paws dwarfed my puppy paws. He wore a somber expression and his arms began to outstretch in my direction." 

    "He sprawled his arms, ready to take me in. A hug? Yes, I wanted to hug him, it’s been a long time friend I-... He concealed his face and the hug was no more. But too late, I fell and kissed the dirt."

    "But I saw in his eyes an expression of absolute terror, he wasn’t only looking at me, but past me, and then his white fur intermingled with my brown fur."

    "Hours? Days? Entire weeks, how much time has passed, and we were locked in our own gazes with paws together. 

    He averted his stare, and was no more looking past me, nor at me. I saw tears drip from his side.

    Instead, he pushed me, shoving me towards the filthy lagoon. And ran away never looking back."

    "I struggled to keep balance. All the figures turned into simple silhouettes of blurred memories."

    "My slow descent met the ice-cold water and the brutal impact engulfed all my senses."

    "Light turned dark, cold turned into warmth..."

    "{i}Am I dying​​​?{/i}"

    "I asked myself without even noticing I had been semi-conscious this entire time."

    "{i}Of course not! I’m not dead, yet!{/i}"

    "I screamed, yelled to the void that surrounded me. I couldn’t hear my own voice. The lagoon turned into a mirror."

    "First, a static forcing me to face away, second, colors started to swirl and mish mash causing me to puke if I had eaten, third, forms and lines manifested."

    "Lastly, it displayed one of my memories. One that I buried deep, like a dirty secret, I never wanted to think about it again."

    "I saw myself, slumped over the corner with one of the bullies taking my arm and swinging me around- When Nemmi came and took me by surprise while screaming to other guys to leave me alone."

    "His tender voice was enough for me, then he proceeded to hug me, saying “It’s ok buddy. I’m here for you”. Even though now, I could hear it, be it muffled through the mirror that separated dream from memory."

    "Nemmi became my fort, my defense against the world. I was 17 and he was 19 at the time, yet age was a minor factor for bullies."

    "We both stuck to each other\'s manners and quirks, Nemmi became my best buddy. But three days after my birthday, May 3rd, Nemmi simply became {i}absent{/i}. Likewise, most folks of the town."

    "Like a recording, the mirror stopped, with me and Nemmi holding hands. It shifted to a proper mirror."

    "There was me. I am a {i}brownish goat of slim stature{/i}."

    "{i}No. {/i}"

    "{i}This is wrong.{/i}"

    "Bringing my {i}hooved {/i}paws to my chest. I was about to puke whatever was churning in my stomach, and it came in a rush and splattered in the ground." 

    "Weakness overcame me, my vision became fuzzy and members limp. As if there was anything to look at...Other than my {i}own reflection{/i}."

    "But I didn’t lose my composure. I stood up again, and attempted to examine my {i}new body{/i}. In my back a symbol? Tattoo? Birthmark? Whatever, stuck out to me."

    "A circle with horns and a plus at the bottom."

    "{i}Looks like that symbol for women, but this one has horns.{/i}"

    "Despite that, my paws continued to display brown fur and hooves-"

    "No, it had changed to a set of colorful scales, terrified I tried to get rid of it."

    "And then I scratched, and scratched."

    "Ripping and ripping them apart."

    "Each and every one of them, it burned, my body stung and tears came down my new face."

    "I tried to call for help, screaming at the top of my lungs."

    "My new scales, and its innards melted, I saw my muscles droop and then-"

    "Light, a blinding flash of light passed through my eyes, or what used to be eyes. I came to be stripped of flesh and bones, transforming into sparkling dust, my feet were no more. It turned liquid dripping its contents everywhere."

    "Running through what remained of my lower parts a runny liquid also made out of starlight dripped and thus I tried to run, rummaging through what I became, thus flashbacks of being another species blind me."

    "I resumed crying... Crying? Were those even tears streaming down my immaterial face? I saw in all directions, the impossible visions beyond the corner of my sight, strange horrors lingering in the darkness. All dark, a thick tar, as opposed to my brilliance."

    "A paw, spun of stars at the end of their life cycles, tried to grab me. Red ribbons moved to intercept its movement. It was nearly five times the size of a house."

    "The red ribbons, ripped one by one, almost didn’t give up to trap and catch and pull and assault the fingers after me. They wanted me, they... He needed me."

    "He touched me."

    "I heard strange words, an unintelligible mixture of what a combination of thousands of instruments and none at all sounded like. Whatever remained of my ears, it hurt my soul."

    "The void engulfed me, drowning in thick substance. I vanished, turning liquid, dust and gas, just to blend in with the surroundings. If it wasn’t for the touch, nor cold or warm; nor textured or smooth."

    "A shock wave, it fired my entire being on dark flames symbols drawn on my fur pattern, I was back! Back to me, but not so much, the paw nowhere to be seen, I was instead in a room carved with symbols top to bottom."

    "I tried to squint my eyes. They were back! I had eyes, muzzle, chest, and belly all of it! And yet I felt like poking them, some of the proportions were wrong, or shifted around."

    "{i}Was I always like this?{/i}"

    "Red ribbons stretched in the ground from them, a scaled being came in. Dragging himself, he tried to hold his hand for me. His snout moved yet his voice rang from up above and covered the room."

    "???" "O, Hydrargyrum, chief of the triad. I’ve opened the door and I endow you with my gift. Stray from the path The Deceiver has set upon you. You are the key, and I have spoken unto you."

    "Words hung in the air, letters that formed words, and words made into poetry. The words were:"

    centered "{i}Paint splattered, mess in order{/i}
    {i}Jigsaw that misses its piece, beauty untouched, irreplaceable{/i}
    {i}Not tool, not bridge, hidden key to the intimate door{/i}
    {i}Made like pyrite, heart of gold{/i}
    {b}Waking up{/b}"

    "I woke up panting and I checked my paws and torso. Only to find my usual fur pattern, and all my rosettes were in their respective places."

    "I was me. I am me. Simply me."

    "The stream of events that took place in my mind exhausted me, but in order to carry on I paw waved my worn out face and began to routinely plan out my day, still laying down."

    "{i}I bet Mr. Sorim will have another heavy workload especially designed for me.{/i}"

    "Rising from what I had considered my place of rest the day before, today I woke up as if it was my coffin. And the palace of pillows and dirty clothes only made worse."

    # "{b}MC showers{/b}"

    "Directing myself to the bathroom, I realized the terrible stink that clung to my clothes, only reinforced by my feverish nightmare. I hadn’t even noticed my morning wood rising. Like a tower, it stood leaning to the left like Pisa, except more fleshy and appetizing to the touch."

    "I turned on the shower head as I tossed my clothes in the dirty-clothes-pile acknowledging my boner. I tried to redirect my thoughts... Only a miserable attempt."

    "To the side, there it was, one of my favorite magazine volumes already denouncing what I really meant with that statement. Simply put, it was my vulgar passtime."

    "I wasn’t exactly proud of it, and, despite it all, I was doubtful about my general taste in {i}people{/i}. I swore I hadn’t yet dated a girl because I was focused on studying."

    "But given my terrible grades (especially in literature and science), it was always a weird sentiment to see others enjoy things I simply never felt interested in."

    "Anyway, enough of soaking in the past. The contents of that sports magazine were simple and often dismissable to the untrained eye, but a single page caught my attention ever since I bought this."

    "There, a soccer player (that unfortunately) had his shorts ripped upon another player grabbed his back attempting to halt his opponent, and thus his shames were visible thanks to the photographer who captured his bubbly butt roundness."

    "A dalmatian, very handsome and of healthy build, unlike me who slumps around wanting but never doing a single push-up, has trained his entire life for that moment."

    "Lost in his features, I turn off the showerhead, dry my paws and take the magazine already featuring his ass. I sit on the toilet lid, admiring both scenes" "The dalmatian’s butt and my dick throbbing."

    "Covered in foamy shampoo, right paw embraced my cock, left paw raised the magazine, in between slow strokes my tip gets soaked in pre-cum "

    "I was in an absolute state of glee each time I rubbed up and down in a steady and yet slow manner as to tease but not release all in too early."

    "I tried to visualize him in other positions, as many I could think. We were both in my bathroom, he tried to tease me as well. His dick--"

    "His dick was a mystery the camera sadly didn’t catch, a detail so elusive as to my weird act of self indulgence. My pace began to quicken, I could feel my raw cock spilling the lubricant substance."

    "He went after me, but soon he faded as my imagination plunged in darkness as the image of Mr. Sorim materialized in front of me. But little did I care, I opened back my eyes and there was him and his ass again."

    "Close, ever so close to the feeling sensation of orgasms when, uninvited it came. I lurched forward and so my rock member spurt its contents in thick strands of cum."

    "Erin" "Huff, huff, huff...{i}Huuff..{/i} That. Was. Good..."

    "A self indulgent act a day doesn’t kill a fly, but, even though it was good, I needed to go back to reality and finish washing myself and get ready to work..."

    "I went back into the shower and properly washed myself, and brushed away the jizz that got on my fur. I wondered many times if people really noticed it. Maybe the smell is what matters."

    "{i}Damn, remember that time I spilled mayonnaise in my fur and a dog could smell it from afar... {/i}"

    "{i}Jeez, that day made me scared of possible scents I sent off into the wild.{/i}"

    "As I finished my shower, my towel took care of my damp fur, and while I considered the best cologne I had available, either a more critical accent for a spring-like vibe or pine for a more earthy but this was a more pleasant scent at paw."

    "{i}Hmmmmm{/i}"

    "There was also strawberry but I needed to get rid of that perfume because it lingered in the bathroom for weeks that one time."

    "Instead settling for the citric more spring-like tones of perfume I finished drying myself and took out the most generic and yet memorable clothing for the day."

    "I anticipated the abusive behaviors of Mr. Sorim, be it followed by the most mundane things Mr. Sorim almost broke my ankles with that stupid walking cane of his. But being downgraded to receptionist work, I finally took a break from him."

    "If this town wasn’t a graveyard and my job wasn’t being surrounded by books, I would’ve quit it, but the joy of reading is neverending, and to me, there are thousands of worlds to be uncovered in each book."

    "{u}{b}Going to work{/b}{/u}"

    "{i}A bike ride to get to work should do the trick of drying my fur, besides, I’m already late.{/i}"

    "It’s not a bad job, but working at the library has its perks. I’m not allowed to read books during shifts, but I\'ve cracked a few spines during my breaks."

    "My bike was thoroughly damaged from the elements, but little did I care if it got me across town in less than 20 minutes. Today looked a bit somber and damp, yesterday’s rain only stopped for a few hours before it came back with a million thunders much later."
    
    "That nightmare, it reminded me of a certain someone. “Careful, today’s extra slippery!”, is what Nemmi would’ve told me."

    "{i}Hmmm...{/i}"

    # "{b}At library{/b}
    
    "Wooden floor creaked, pages turned, clicked pens, and sometimes patrons snored; the library was filled with noise. Mr. Sorim, the receptionist, was a pain in the ass. He always managed to kill the mood."

    "My job was simple" "organizing and labeling books. The town was known for not funneling funds into the library, so the place could collapse at any moment. With me inside."

    "Over the section of Religion and Spirituality, a book’s spine shined:"

    "{i}In Elementia Ego Credo Et Prima Verbum, Une Thèse Sur Les Éléments Alchimiques. “In The Elements I Believe And The First Word, A Dissertation In The Alchemical Elements”{/i}"

    "Coated in gold, the letters sparkled, reflecting the little sunlight that intruded into the cramped corner the book was located."

    "{i}Interesting...{/i}"

    "{i}Latin mixed with... Spanish? No, that was definitely French.{/i}"

    "The trilingual book revealed to be more than concerned with Alchemy. Occultism, Kabbalah, and Gnosticism. All that knowledge condensed within these pages."

    "I ripped off a small piece of paper and scribbled down where the elusive book was located. Then, back to work. I forgot I still had to take out some damaged books and send them to repair."

    "A few books damaged by moths and time, two cooking books that were last borrowed four years ago, one guinness book from the ‘90s, and lastly two heavily used Playboy magazines..."

    "{i}I need to wash my paws. Immediately.{/i}"

    "Even though I was disgusted by those heavily used Playboy magazines, I still had to finish what I started, and as soon I sealed those in a box to send to repair, I rushed towards the men’s washroom."

    "I forgot to look ahead. Ahead of me, there was a white fluffy(?) pillar wearing a white button with a red tie. It stood a few paces from me, and I was going in it’s direction, I--"

    # "*Bam!*" #[sound of books falling]"

    "It wasn’t just a fluffy pillar, it was a fluffy polar bear that would be towering over me if I hadn’t run into him. We scrambled on the ground. Open books to the left and me, on top of him."

    "{i}Oh no. Shit, shit, shit, shiieeet, SHITE."

    "Jolting away from him, I try not to make eye contact else that would mean I was screwed for life. Grabbing the books"

    "{b}Erin bumps with Miq{/b}"

    "Erin" "Oh my! Sir, I’m so, so, so, sorry! Please let me--"

    "???" "No, no, no. It’s ok. Just let me get up-- Aaand, okay."

    "Erin" "No sir, I insist. I- I messed things up. Sorr-"

    "{i}I had to fix this, I had to fix things so that...{/i}"

    "I mumbled my {i}fixing-mantra{/i} every time I messed up big time. And this time, I fucked up bad, worse, it was a fine gentleman. I almost ran over like a crazy train."

    "???" "Hey, hey... HEY!"

    "I blinked, looked up, and there he was, a mysterious man of sturdy stature. He looked angry but also sensitive."

    "???" "Sorry. I just need you to stop."

    "Erin" "Why? I messed up, so now I’m cleaning things. Besides, I work here."

    "???" "Woah, woah...No need to get feisty, little one."

    "Erin" "Hey! I’m not a child. I’m 22 years old! How about you old hag."

    "???" "*Grunt* You don’t get to call me that, runt. I’m just 37 years old."

    "Erin" "Still older."

    "???" "Fine, have it your way. Besides the discussion, there are still books on the floor."

    "Erin" "Weren\'t you the one that wanted to stop me, by yelling?"

    "???" "Oh, come on. You’re just being insufferable now. I drove nine hours straight, no breaks,to get to this city. Just to fight with you."

    "Erin" "Oh, I’m sorry Mr. Fancy Pants, my town is a real shit hole, so why would you waste your fancy time here?"

    "???" "It’s for my final thesis."

    "{i}That caught me off guard. Mom always told me to go to university, but I heard uni was a crappy place for potheads to get high.{/i}"

    "Erin" "Huh, final thesis."

    "???" "Yep, the worst financial decision of my entire life. Last semester I passed with slim chances, because my professor gave {i}handwritten tests{/i}."

    "Erin" "Fuck, that sounds ridiculous. I knew uni was weird, but this is kinda goofy."

    "Erin" "So, you majoring in what, fluff head?"

    "???" "Anthropology, tangled mess of rosettes."

    "Erin" "Tangled mess of what? Look big man, your comebacks suck ass. Like you!"

    "???" "Fuck off."

    "Erin" "Maybe not here."

    "???" "Gross! You don’t know my name."

    "Erin" "Fine. The name’s Erin. You?"

    "Miq" "Michael, but just call me Miq."

    "Erin" "Miq, Miq, Meak.... Milk!"

    "Miq" "Milk me?"

    "Erin" "Now {i}you’re {/i}being gross."

    "Miq" "You started with the insults."

    "Erin" "Ok, fine. I’m going to be more {i}polite{/i}."

    "Miq" "There, was it hard? I bet you almost popped some bones, the rudeness bone and the tickle-me-politeness bone."

    "Erin" "Shut up...."

    "An awkward silence fell heavy. We were both standing there with two books ready to be picked up from the mess. It took me too long to notice them. When I did, I picked them up and gave them to the bear."

    "I almost wanted to speak up, because I had no reason to be rude with him, yet he stayed. Must be interested, or {i}I’m{/i} interested. I wonder if it would be rude to ask him out to the café across the street."

    "Erin" "Uhhh, I know I’ve been trying to keep up this rude facade but, would you like to go somewhere else, I mean, the café across the street?"

    "Miq" "Oh! Hmmm... I don’t know, really. I’m still looking for very specific archives from the city and I have no idea where the city hall is and-"

    "Erin" "So, you’re a complete tourist."

    "Miq" "What I mean is, I need instructions or even a guide to help me with my studies."

    "Erin" "You found yourself lucky. I know this shit-town by hand, I can lead you to the city hall. But, Café time! Then, we can go to the city hall. Deal?"

    "I saw him rolling his eyes, unsure if that was the best outcome for him, but I was in for a win. He was handsome and delectable to the homoerotic desires that stirred within me."

    "Miq" "Deal."

    "Erin" "Great!"

    "After a second, I got reminded of where we were, still at the library...{i}Screaming{/i}... How didn’t anyone notice it? Maybe the true answer lies within the fact it was ever visited. {i}Besides for the more “immoral” part of this library.{/i}"

    "17:25 I clocked out, and was free from work for the rest of the day. If babysitting books was a dignified job, then I was the owner of the Moon. But this town lacked basic infrastructure, so you work with what you have."

    "At café"

    "Slumped over the counter, awakened by our stomps, the barista scans us up and down. I set my eyes upon the menu."

    "Erin" "Milkshake for us two please. Chocolate and..."

    "Miq" "Chocolate too."

    "She nods and disappears from our sight into the kitchen."

    "The last time I asked for a milkshake, me and Nemmi were sitting outside. Our table had a dandy umbrella casting the perfect shade on the hottest day of the way. That day, Mom gave me some extra cash, we had to spend it on the best milkshake in town."

    "Nemmi was rather relaxed on that summer day, he resumed whistling and humming a song he had listened to on radio. I was fond of him, and when our milkshakes arrived, we kept chatting the rest of the day off."

    "{i}Ahh...Nemmi, I miss you buddy. I really do.{/i}"

    "Miq" "Oi! Hey! Our milkshakes are here."

    "Erin" "Oh right, sorry, I was just thinking about someone."

    "Both our milkshakes came in a glass cup, plastic straw and they all had a foamy surface. It was mundane as always, this time a different flavor may I say, less tones of chocolate and more of whatever they could replace with it."

    "Miq" "Soo, Erin, a very peculiar name for a bloke like you."

    "Erin" "Yeah? Miq looks like it came out of a cheap superhero comic."

    "Miq" "Oh come on, can you please settle with the insults? We’ve already talked about moving past this petty discussion."

    "Erin" "*Hmph* Ok, Mr. Fancy Pants. About your research, what does it really entail?"

    "Miq" "Confidential, top secret- Nah, I’m just joking. It’s nerd stuff, don’t even worry about it."

    "Erin" "Now you caught my attention. Just tell me what’s about it, I’m not that dense. In fact, I have read a lot of non-fiction books, namely, {i}The Epic Of Gilgamesh{/i} and {i}Mesopotamia and the Birth of Civilisation{/i}."

    "Miq" "Oh, never took you for a cultured one."

    "Erin" "Yeah,  yeah, cut your bullshit. I like history too, but I like fiction more."

    "Miq" "You never seem to stop impressing me, little one, sir Erin."

    "Although he was courting me with a condescending tone, I shouldn’t let my guard down, even though he has the hot dad bod, I don’t know what he\'s capable of."

    "Erin" "Soo, you’re not gonna tell me, aren’t you?"

    "Miq" "Ah, d’accord. My final thesis is about towns untouched by the modern world, and getting a snapshot into the past like that. Talking to elders and recording folk tales too, how they contributed to form our modern selves."

    "Erin" "So, you’re just horny for data. Well, to that, I sayAureliopolis, middle of nowhere, two hours away from civilization and the shittiest town in Goiás."

    "Miq" "Exactl-- What. *Sigh* Ok, to put it simply, and vulgar, yes. I am horny for data. And thanks for the late welcome."

    "Erin" "Pervert for books, hah!"

    "His efforts to not shake the table were to be unsuccessful. In fact, he jerked it and milkshake now painted his garments."

    "Miq" "Oh no. Ehh."

    "Erin" "Ah, let me get a paper towel-- Damn, I swear they had those everywhere last time--"

    "Miq" "Do you mind if I take my shirt off?"

    "Erin" "{i}What{/i}. No? I mean, is that even appropriate."

    "I remembered Dad was always shirtless. I couldn’t help but squirm and distort my face to even think of being shirtless in front of other people. But Dad did that so casually in front of others... I wanted to be free, but I had weird standards when it came to body display.

    Uhh, I don’t think people will mind it. I should also follow suit."

    "Miq" "Great!"

    "He unbuttoned his shirt and loosened his tie, folding them in circular motion, one that wrinkled his clothes. I copied..."

    "Now, I didn’t know where this was going, but it was an interesting treat to see him without his shirt, I guess more candy for my eyes."

    "We finished our milkshakes in tandem, I went back inside and paid for our milky drinks and when I  got back, Miq was ready to take off, still shirtless."

    "Erin" "So, I think I promised you something."

    "Miq" "Exactly, I guess we should be off to the city hall. But before that, I have a tiny request. Can I hug you?"

    "Unexpected as it sounds, hugging a stranger wasn’t on my list of socially acceptable things to do. But I guess they’re trivial, fur-to-fur embraces." 

    "Erin" "Eh, why not, come here big guy!"

    "And, how I imagined, fur-to-fur contact. Unmatted and well groomed, covered in traces of lavender alongside with citrus undertones settled on my snout as I snuggled myself on his neck, not a fluffy neck per se, but enough to warm me up."

    "I pulled myself away from his tight embrace, his arms limp and face wore confusion, I couldn’t bear it. It was me, but I just wasn’t ready yet. 

    Sorry, I’m just not ready y’know?"

    "Miq" "Ah, apologies if I was being too forward. I am free spirited, and try to cheer others up. I always say “No need to worry. Just live in the moment”."

    "Erin" "That’s ok, it’s just that--"

    "Miq" "You’re not into men?"

    "A shock ran through my spine deafening my senses as I stood rather awkwardly in front of this one unit of hot men."

    "Erin" "Nononono, it’s not that... I mean, it’s just unconventional? You see, I was just insulting you a few moments ago, and now we’re hugging. See, I literally called you old hag."

    "Miq" "And, what? I forgive you. I just thought hugging could do a lot better. Ease things up between us."

    "Erin" "Okayy, alright. Damn, you’re really hot."

    "{i}Shit, this was so uncalled for.{/i}"

    "Miq" "Oh, thanks. I mean, people never talked about me this way. Usually, just call me fatty."

    "Erin" "But you’re just, you. This is the ideal body type for me."

    "Miq" "For others, it is not."

    "Erin" "Fuck them all."

    "Miq" "Gross!"

    "Erin" "What? Just flip them off, it’s not like they ever cared about you in the first place."

    "Miq" "I guess that’s fair. But knowing I am the ideal body type for someone else is quite refreshing, y’know."

    "Erin" "Ah, I also struggle with body and stuff. My Mom used to say ‘You need to eat more, you’re like a skeleton.’ And while at the time I tried to view it in a good light, nowadays I see it as mean."

    "Miq" "I see, I’m sorry."

    "Erin" "Nah, don’t mention it. That’s the reason I moved to my house. Now I live with my brother, he sometimes comes and goes, mostly stays with Mom."

    "Erin" "Anyway, it’s getting late so... I should be on my way..."

    "Miq" "Well, we could spend the night instead of abruptly ending our fun."

    "Erin" "Fun? Big dude, you’re kinda delusional, but fuck it. I don’t have work tomorrow, so you better have something planned."

    "Miq" "So, you’re a bark no bite, just like a bottom."

    "Erin" "Hah, wrong of you to assume I’d ever let you in. Besides we just met, the fuck, you trying to kill me or something?"

    "Miq" "You’re no fun to play with, I was just tryna lighten up the mood."

    "Erin" "With sex? What happened with cuddles and holding hands, is it that kinky for you?"

    "Miq" "You’re getting on my nerves, but sure, I just wanted to have some fun in this town, described by you as a shit-hole."

    "Erin" "Very well, you gained my attention, but I’m not bottoming for you. You\'re bottoming for me."

    "Miq" "Fine, then. Let’s go by your rules. But you still need to tell me where the cheapest motel is. I’ll drive and pay for the best room."

    "Erin" "It’s tantalizing. Come on, follow my lead."

    "The stars shone bright and I shivered from the cold brushing against my fur. Miq wore a stoic demeanor, focused on our destination."

    "He had only a backpack to store his belongings" "Dirty clothes, smashed paper, and four clean briefs."

    "I, on the other hand, was questioning what we would end up doing. Just jerk each other off? Suck his dick? Or, just have sex."

    "I didn’t know, but I was calm and tender, not numb, but passive to the idea of spending my first night with another man."

    "Red lights all around, seven pillows on the bed. I set myself to check the mattress for any bed bugs, meanwhile I tasked Miq to check the other half of the bedroom and bathroom. To the side of the bed a small freezer with condoms on top and some lube."

    "Luckily Miq brought his own lube and condoms. I didn’t know how to put one on, but now was the time to put my brief knowledge about sex to practice."

    "Erin" "So..."

    "Miq" "Never been to a motel before?"

    "Erin" "Hmm, no."

    "Miq" "You’re lucky, this is going to be the best night. First things first, how do you like it?"

    "Erin" "Hmmm, simple? I guess."

    "Miq" "Ah, not as kinky as I thought, very well. You already said who’s topping. But are you really comfortable though? I don’t wanna upset you anything, but we need to be in a headspace to do this."

    "Erin" "Hmm, so, a bit of teasing would be fine. How about a kiss?"

    "Miq" "Hmm, Sure."

    "The bed creaked as I leaned closer to him in an awkward position, closing my eyes I smacked my lips on his and tried to lick him. He pushed me."

    "Miq" "Ouch! Easy, easy. Here, let me guide you. You stay put and I guide you through it."

    "I nodded, and followed his lead this time."

    "He leaned in, but this time he instead caressed my cheek fluffs and guided his paw towards my neck. It settled even lower and he gently brushed my back and trailed through my fur. I tried to do the same."

    "We locked gazes, no words exchanged. He proceeded to open his muzzle and so did I. At first our tongues were shy, then when the tension in between us broke, they danced. And I tilted my head to the left, his to the right and so we were kissing."

    "In between steady moans and sloppy sounds, he was experienced and I was merely tagging along. Turns out you just need to turn off your brain and let your instincts decide for you. Which, sure, was once my pants feel tighter than ever."

    "Our first kiss, but he didn’t stop at that. He cupped my crotch as we parted lips."

    "Miq" "So, how’d you feel?"

    "Erin" "Like, I want more."

    "Miq" "Hehehe. So it’s better if we do this au naturel."

    #"{b}Sex scene with Miq{/b}"

    "Miq" "So, you never had sex before, right?"

    "I nod. The prospects of anyone getting down to business in this godforsaken town is as unlikely. At least I should thank someone like Miq who showed up."

    "Miq plopped on the sofa and invited me to join him as he laid down. Both of us were just casually naked looking at each other."

    "Even though it was my house, my muscles were clenching hard and stiffness took hold of me."

    "A paw runned across my back and shoulders, Miq massaged me, digging his heavy hands in sore places, rigid muscles and matted fur."

    "Miq" "Looks like someone’s in dire need of a massager..."

    "Erin" "Don’t tell me... This city is no fun..."

    "Miq" "Atta boy, I’ll need you to relax and go with the flow. Can you lay down on the sofa so I can get a better grip?"

    "Erin" "Mmyeah..."

    "I turned around and exposed my bare back and butt to Miq, and as soon as I laid down he started his work, around muscles and readjusting my posture each time he pressed on a sore spot."

    "Moans escaped as Miq slided his hands through my back and lower back eventually he stopped at the rim of my butt."

    "Miq" "Well, would you look at that... Are you feeling comfortable?"

    "Erin" "Please continue..."

    "Silently, he diligently continued his task that melted and relaxed me. He knew how to treat a man. Gosh, I needed that so badly."

    "Miq" "Now... If you excuse me, your butt is in dire need for attention, but don’t worry I’ll treat it right away..."

    "His hands settled in my ass, as he pressed further he squished and enveloped my butt like bread dough."

    "Miq" "Everything okay?"

    "I grunted in response followed by a moan."

    "Miq" "Easy, easy... Now, I think it’s time you turn around..."

    "As I turned around my cock throbbed. I hadn’t even noticed my cock was rock hard when I looked up to Miq, but as I traced my eyes down, his cock was already drenched in ropes of precum."

    "Miq" "You’re an eager boy, here let me just..."

    "He jumped off the sofa, and took a cushion with him, placed it on the floor and kneeled. Gestures and silent nods were all part of this sex language, we all acquire by observation."

    "Once we were both in positions, Miq reserved words for later, instead he worshipped my cock, fondled with my balls. A single drop of precum was enough to denounce my lust for this man."

    "He opened his mouth to receive my cock, his tongue started on my balls, then onto my shaft he traced his tongue with eyes shut. Glistening with saliva, my cock throbbed and begged for more."

    "My cock filled his mouth, he savoured it all, smell, taste and texture. Steady movements, up and down, he rested his head and my cock was deep, he didn’t hesitate to take it all, and even gag on it."

    "He pulled out."

    "Miq" "Nice and slippery, although let’s play safe. Protection first place."

    "Better than anything, Miq knew how to accommodate, set the pace and do the deeds. A man like him must’ve had a pretty active sex life, as opposed to me, a slob, had no sex life."

    "He raised and stretched, our cocks still throbbing, his cock bounced around as he walked towards his baggage and ruffled through the mess. Condom and lube in hands."

    "Miq gave me the necessary gear and turned around, exposing his pulsating butthole. I knew what to do next, put the condom and lube him."

    "Miq" "If you’re worried, I already cleaned down there and took PrEP at 5AM."

    "He’s such a slut."

    "Erin" "I’ve never done this so, don’t expect anything-"

    "Miq" "‘Tis fine."

    "The sofa wasn’t the optimal place to have sex. Regardless of that, I followed his instructions, nodding while he was raising his butt to me."

    "He told me to lick it and coat his taint and pucker. I didn’t know the rules to sex, but if this was it, then I should follow suit."

    "My tongue caressed, and played with this hole, first shyly, then I became bolder and penetrated my tongue. The absolute smell of manliness he exhaled filled me, each stroke he yelped and moaned, relaxing his muscles."

    "Hypnotized by this absolute unit of a man, all that was left was to graciously position myself and my throbbing cock."

    "It looked so hungry, I wanted to fill it. I needed to!"

    "It felt... different than I expected once I slid into his ass. The warm walls of his insides were comfortably hugging my dick, and so I started to thrust into him."

    "Thrust after thrust, I felt my rock-solid dick go in and out. I tried to be attentive to his moans as well. He was really into it."

    "I quickened my pace, and soon I felt the ultimate pleasure once I filled the condom with ropes of cum."

    "I didn’t want to pull out of him just yet, but I felt entirely drained of energy. It made me realize sex demands great physical strength and preparation, and for the first time was amazing, and though exhausted, the reward was a million times better than money."

    "I slowly removed my still erect cock from his ass. In the process, my condom fell into the darkness of my room."

    "It was quickly shoved aside by either Miq or me. I didn’t know who did it, and I didn’t care."

    "With the bear occupying a large section of the bed, there was only a mere 30 centimeters width of bed left for me, and I worried I would fall from the bed."

    "Maybe he would hold me tight during our sleep like when we first cuddled together."

    "I tried to snuggle close to him. He suddenly stopped snoring and, making a rough sound, rolled to the other side of the bed. Finally, he gave me a proper space to sleep."

    "And so I fell asleep, still wanting to talk to him."

    "I hoped we could finish our night on a more communicative note, something like:‘Woah dude, I didn’t know sex was this amazing!’"

    "But it could be odd to talk about sex that way. It would be best not to talk to him right now since he’s all sleepy, right?"
