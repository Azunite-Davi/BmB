    "The cold bitterness that plagued the still hall of moment-captured memories and sealed cardboard boxes felt extremely vacant with forgotten ghosts from yore that day."
    "Moving away from chaos was always a dream of ours, and in 1958, Dad finally got the perfect opportunity…"
    "Dad was the pillar that held us together against all the world’s uncertainties."  
    "And on the day we lost him in that damn car accident, the wind stopped feeling the same, and the rain began falling slowly and foreign to my senses. The entire town somehow changed. My own perspective about the events of that day was buried deep in my mind."
    "Allowing myself to remember that unfortunate day wasn’t only a painful reminder of our own mortal nature but also the sole and only reference I had to the incontestable fact that he was no longer with us, and that didn’t matter much to others."
    "Mom, me, and my brother were the only ones mourning for Dad."
    "Each drop of rain sharply pierced the still heat in me, reminding me of years of love and dedication, all gone in vain due to a simple yet blunt mistake."
    "I loved him, but there was always something that irked me when we first stepped into this town just a few months ago. Both the town and the townsfolk were absent."
    "I told myself multiple times it was merely a matter of getting used to the climate and maybe the local culture."
    "But school bullies encrusted in my mind the deep sense of not belonging, their familiar faces washed with hatred towards my lack of strength."
    "Three to four years or so ago, I met Nemmi when I was 15 years old.  It was the day after my birthday at the school cafeteria after some bullies had stolen my lunch bag."
    "We instantly became best friends. Of course, he was most motivated to protect me, but our time together blossomed into friendship. We’d go out on adventures and even play chess sometimes in secluded corners."
    "We discovered an old abandoned cabin by the river. It became our little secret, the kind of secret that prompted us to become even more familiar with each other’s presence."
    "We organized adventures, stories, and all kinds of kids' play. We were too young to notice the decay that plagued the place."
    "It was our fantastical world, a spark of light in my life once the darkness settled in after Dad had passed away."
    "After a rough week of heavy rain, I only wanted to see Nemmi because I remembered our special spot was also a place for quiet conversation. We sometimes sat down to discuss the town’s folk and their whereabouts."
    "When I got to the cabin, it was dark, empty, and damp. In the center were two crooked chairs we used for various purposes. Despite all that, I sat and waited. Mold got to my nose, and the urge to sneeze came upon me."
    "Still, I remained until the eerie ambiance ceased my breath. The life exiting my lungs woke me up, and I ran back home panting."
    "From that day on, I never saw Nemmi again. Even at school, he was always absent, skipping class or not even leaving his home. Some kids thought about visiting him."
    "But it was as if Nemmi was gone…"
    "And once again, I was afraid."
