    # "{b}Cryptic dream sequence, hallucination{/b}
    # {b}...{/b}"

    "A whirlpool of multicolored hues stained my vision. All kinds of unknown figures, bloodthirsty monsters, and rampant memories, mixed together in an amalgamation that was about to boil and churn and spew its contents."

    "One of the monsters peered into my soul, spilling its tongue like a flaming sword, its jaw cluttered with teeth."

    "The abyss formed at my feet, and on the way down, thousands of teeth greeted me followed by stillness. A tinnitus made its presence be heard in my ears."

    "What followed was a myriad of sensations, the cracking of a bone, twisting guts and screams of agony. I was consumed, gobbled up by the barbaric beast."

    "I was robbed of my senses. I disintegrated into nothingness. The void was me and I was no more."

    "..."

    "Time became a substance with tentacles that reconstructed me from the ground up, the undoing of the monster’s labor gone.  "

    "As I immersed myself even more into the abyss, it turned into walkable ground, with a smooth yet oddly harsh texture — nothing like silky cloth or a rocky mountain."

    # "{b}Mountain path{/b}"

    "I looked down to see my nude body, but shame didn’t wash over me."

    "A swampy field with mountains off in the distance. My steps sinked in the mud; my fur, soaked in lukewarm water."

    "I wandered aimlessly in search of answers, but to no avail. Mud slushed around, sunk my feet and soaked my fur. A rancid smell, taste of death and heavyweight air polluted my senses."

    "A piercing gust of wind isolated me from the rest of the place. This place rejected me. It reeked of desperation to dispel me, but then why was I here? Have I never belonged here? "

    "I started running. I feared perhaps I was dead or maybe hadn’t come into existence just yet."

    "Over and over again, this period marked my independence, from inside to outside, from warmth to cold, from one to two."

    "I tried not to delve much into the eeriness this strange place offered me. Castles atop giant mountains revealed the truth of my presence. I was a mere ant; I could be ignored."

    "Yet I tried to climb the mountain, my sisyphean task. The castle crowned the peak, and heavy gates dwarfed me."

    "The gates opened upon my presence, but maybe it wasn’t for me; maybe it was for someone else, so I waited."

    "I waited until it dawned on me that it was better to enter and delight myself with what might be awaiting me there, be it death, life, secrets unbeknownst to menkind."

    "Down in the halls, each wall told a history—an untold history of eons ago, when things were just beginning."

    "Over and over, I passed through tapestries that revealed the past; perhaps a past we ought to forget one day."

    "Alone is an insufficient word to describe what it feels like to be the only living being. A dream? Am I dreaming? If reality even exists, it must be the infinite extension of this castle into some impossible land."

    " None of them seemed to be the answer, an answer to this castle that so pounded my head with infinite questions."

    "At the end of the hall, it diverged into two halls, both to the left and to the right that span to the end of the world. Three tapestries hung above me."

    "It’s a story told in three acts" ""

    "{b}Exposition,{w} Confrontation{w} and Climax{/b}."

    "A story bigger than me displayed in all its glory."

    "Is this my story? Is it how the world ends? "

    "The third however, {b}Climax{/b}, was only half completed. Someone was writing our destinies. I needed to find them."

    "Upon closer inspection, the corridor to the left revealed a dungeon with an open giant door. Each step closer a shiver ran down my spine."

    "The amicable aura of the castle grew colder and threatening. I hadn\'t noticed before,  but the castle was made out of obsidian, each glassy brick sucked the life out of me."

    "I sneaked past the door frame and almost entered the room, the door left ajar for me revealed symbols that ran and span across the entire complex of the room, the ceiling was intricate with more symbols, maybe one of those I saw in a book."

    "To the center stood a figure in an altar, unrecognizable to me, a cube with a pyramid as a head, detailed symbols adorned its four sides. It had closed eyes symbols and red threads running across its apex. Each thread oozed a liquid forming a moat to protect its precious fortitude."

    "One of the threads was detached from the bundle, put aside by whoever was the last person to visit the room. My curiosity peaked, and I held it. Nothing happened at first."

    "Some of the dripping liquid even soaked my paws, so I closely inspected it. Stretching and trying to rip it in pieces."

    "I was transported to the same room, but with subtle differences,in the absence of the stone pillar in the center and the various threads."

    "From afar, a conversation started. I cowered in a corner. I had forgotten I was naked, but shame didn’t wash over me."

    "Mul" "MulObelisk"

    "Obelisk" "Your misbehaving has tainted your image, and your presence is no longer welcome in my humble abode."

    "Obelisk" "Must I need to make this even more clear than the finest and most perfect grain of diamond in the universe?"

    "Obelisk" "You will fail and bring forth disappointment. A heavy hand will fall upon you."

    "Mul" "Challenging with fine rhetoric won’t lead me astray from my own goals. I have already won the game, and you were only a pawn."

    "Obelisk" "You make yourself greater, but it\'s not a game to begin with."

    "Obelisk" "Toiling with their existence can cause greater harm to them."

    "Mul" "Shut up. I didn’t come up here for perception and clarity."

    "Mul" "I’m already broken from the disappearance of my brother, our brother."

    "Obelisk" "He’s gone because you failed once, and you will fail twice."

    "Mul" "Why do you keep me away from the truth? Just tell me, there’s no harm in it."

    "Obelisk" "If truth is what you seek, then the truth you shall get. At last, just leave me be, my duties are never done."

    "Obelisk" "Adamu, the beloved, has strayed from the path I have weaved, but even so I fully support his decision. However, it is with great sadness that he’s no longer with us."

    "Mul" "May I reword it"

    "Obelisk" "What, you plan on bringing him forth again from whatever state he may have turned into?"

    "Mul" "I don’t care what Adamu did or does. I only cared for him while he was by my side."

    "Mul" "I haven\'t heard of him in eons after our first encounter following the formation of our plan."

    "Mul" "But you treat me with unprecedented disrespect as if I wasn\'t from the same order as you."

    "Obelisk" "Your offense has worn me out...!"

    "An earthquake reverberated through the entire castle, as if it were dismantling, and so the pillars shifted and bent to form spears, swords and arrowheads, which repeated on themselves like they were mirrored or repeated."

    "The tapestry covering my nuts had been lifted. I stumbled and slipped, my fur pressing against the chilling obsidian glass, once I noticed a roll of pillars coming up my way."

    "My attempts to grab on the slippery surface were all in vain. I fell down at a staggering speed."

    "They looked directly at me, two divine beings majesty of time and space. The one on the right made out of the night sky, he assumed a crown made out of agony and sorrow. The other one was a rock with thousands of symbols in boiling red."

    "I saw them both squabbling and fighting, after losing their temper they looked at me if not past me. The rock subjugated the king with no realm to reign on."

    "The king of the night out stretched its arms to touch me, still under the superior being’s influence."

    "I closed my eyes to prepare for the incoming giant hands... but nothing happened."
    
    "Instead, sharp blades of cold were piercing through my skin... I was falling, much to my disgrace."

    # "{b}Waking up day 2{/b}

    "I braced for impact with the ground and–y, I... was jolted from my dream. In spite of my efforts to make myself more comfortable, the l space given to me in my slumber was incredibly tiny."

    "Still, I figured out it would be better if Miq spent the night in a more comfortable manner since he must’ve had a long car trip."

    "As soon as I thought of what his travel must have been like, a chilly sensation brushed against my fur. Once the morning light rays slapped my eyes, it was almost identical to what I felt yesterday, in the same order of events, but this time his bed was..."

    "Empty, devoid of him. I slumped to the side and still, nothing. I figured out he maybe went to a restaurant or was in the bathroom."

    "Ah, there he was! But, better to wait instead of barging myself in and interrupting his morning ritual."

    "I sat in the bed and awaited his return.  He exited from the bathroom and with a towel wrapped around his waist he invited me for a hug. I was getting used to hugging this man."

    "Maybe I was too touch starved over the years, but being able to just hug someone is the best sensation. Still, I needed to come with terms that I barely knew him and maybe placing some physical distance was a better idea."

    "Miq" "Hey, good morning spotty."

    "Erin" "Hey, bleached grizzly, I have a name! Also hold on, you dropped your towel!"

    "Miq" "Oops! Gotta get dressed, today’s a big day."

    "Erin" "For what?"

    "Miq" "City hall, did’ya forget? "

    "Erin" "Ah yeah, so we’re going right now?"

    "Miq" "Yes! The early bird catches the worm."

    "Erin" "Very well."

    "We got dressed and went outside. Miq paid for our stay and the used condoms and lube from last night."

    "First time I stepped into the city hall, many of the people I saw there, including some polars bears were going from one room to another sprinting across the reception desk and into the outside."

    "They were all minding their business, the receptionist barely acknowledged Miq and I. The sea of polar bears dressed in formal attires gave Miq a boost in his confidence. Me, on the other hand, only wanted to get things done."

    "Huh! Wait- What? No, it must be my imagination."

    "Upon close inspection, I couldn’t believe it. It was him! He was here! But, how? Wasn’t he missing from a few years ago? No way! "

    "Nemmi" "Erin? Is that you?"

    "Erin" "Nemmi! I can’t believe it’s you dude, I missed you, everyone was freaking out a little bit!"

    "I opened my arms and adjusted my best smiling face. He staggered to the side to avoid me, but I towered and cornered him in a fluffy embrace."

    "Nemmi" "Hey, hey, big guy, steady. What are you doing here?"

    "Not the friendliest of the hugs, but ok."

    "Erin" "Hey, I just came by with that other big guy and here I find you! Where have you been this entire time!?"

    "Nemmi" "Uhh, here? I’ve always been here, Erin. It was you who never came to see me."

    "Erin" "No way dude, I was out and about everyday, I work at the library just a few-"

    "Nemmi" "I know? I mean, on my way to the city hall I {i}always{/i} pass in front of the library. I saw you with him."

    "Erin" "Oh, I didn’t see you, but I missed you and I never saw you after our school graduation. What happened?"

    "Nemmi" "I mean life, my life happened. After that day you simply vanished. You never came and stopped by the park where we used to hang out after school. Dude, you left me worried sick."

    "Nemmi" "And then, when I finally see you, you’re almost kissing that man!? What the fuck, Erin. You don\'t even know him!"

    "Erin" "Woah, calm down Nemmi. I didn’t go anywhere, I’m here, I’m always here."

    "Nemmi" "How come? I never saw you, and I looked everywhere. This town ain’t that big, Erin, I know people."

    "Erin" "Dude, I was by the library, my house and the café we used to hang out at. Where could I possibly hide if you searched everywhere."

    "Nemmi" "Look, I have work to do, and I just... *Sigh* Just tell me what you came here for."

    "Erin" "You’re just going to ignore the elephant in the room? "

    "Nemmi" "Erin."

    "Erin" "What? Now you’re gonna tell me I was invisible? I missed you dude, ever since last time we hugged."

    "Nemmi" "Erin, please, not here."

    "Erin" "WHAT!? ... !! Oh my god, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry-"

    "Nemmi" "Go, shoo!"

    "Erin" "..."

    "Nemmi" "Go! Do what you came here for and give me some fucking space, Jesus Christ, you need to control your nerves."

    "He exits to the back of the receptionist desk."

    "I sulked, unsure where I should bury my head, the wooden floor, my own clothes or inside Miq’s car."

    "Erin" "FINE! IT’S NOT LIKE I’VE BEEN WAITING TO SEE YOU FOR A LONG TIME. I- I just wanted to see a FRIEND."

    "I lifted my foot to kick the door in response, when Miq landed his paw on my shoulder, coercing me to calm down as he gestured towards a quiet corner."

    "Miq" "Hey, you ok? You don’t need to scream."

    "Erin" "HMPH...Yeah, yeah... I’m ok, he’s just being stupid."

    "Miq" "He’s your friend? Why wasn’t he happy to see you?"

    "Erin" "...Whatever, let’s move on, there should be the town’s archive third turn down the corridor."

    "He began scratching his chin and shoulders in a worrisome way.  I wanted to ask him if everything was ok, but hid my face in response to his thundering speech towering over all the other sounds."

    "Miq" "Very well."

    "Miq" "I hope we may find all the necessary documents to dissect what this town has to offer."

    "In a cramped space where light struggled to persevere, me and Miq had to wait for somebody to come and tell us where we should begin our research–or at least, how to light the room."

    "He walked down the corridor with towers and towers of binders, many decorated with photos, contracts and schematics, Miq tried to soften his voice to call her, but his efforts came to no avail."

    "Miq" "Good morning, ma’am. May I please be directed to the town’s historical records and possibly maps, schematics, or a general recording of the history?"

    "A spasm in her right eye, raised lips and confused expression painted a recognizable picture" "she just wanted to get things done and go home."

    "Finally, she sighed and started."

    "Lady" "It’s this door here. Here, let me light it up for you. Feel free to explore the archives, and don’t forget to sign your names, date and hour. It’s for our records. Don’t break anything. Ok, bye, I need to go."

    "Miq" "Uhh, thanks! So, let’s research things."

    "The disarray of unpacked boxes covered in years of thick layers of dust made searching even more unbearable. I was coughing like hell, and I couldn’t keep my nose away from it. I started sneezing uncontrollably."

    "I changed positions to accommodate my sore back after being still. After sifting I picked up and returned the books, a single hardcover stood out to me. It was a book Miq had shoved to the side in hopes of finding something even more useful for his research..."

    "Nothing much remarkable about that piece of history, but knowing everything in that room should be noteworthy. I took the task to sift through what Miq shoved away or hasn’t seen yet."

    "Case coated in green had no title, no author or any pattern on its cover. Inside, yellowed out, moth eaten pages of unopened years unfurled.e."

    # "{b}Research time #[mysterious book]{/b}"

    "Upon closer inspection, I skimmed through several pages, many had graphs, cryptic symbols and some weird lore about witches and hermeticism, whatever that means. One page managed to catch my attention."

    "Akin to a Renaissance painting... No, more like one of those books on occultism with hundreds of ciphers. The book proudly displayed its most confusing page to me, elusive of meaning."

    "Tick-tack, the clock announced. I kept exploring every crevice of that image, probably printed page by page with Gutenberg’s invention and distributed only by the most secretive societies of the age, somehow ending up here."

    "A white fur paw passed in front of my muzzle, attempting to bring me back to reality, but my brain barely registered it."

    "Miq" "Hey, bookworm, you’ve been staring at this page for half an hour."

    "Miq" "You good, sweet?"

    "His speech jolted me from my self-induced trance. I finally began to reassess my surroundings. It seemed nothing changed apart from a few more books being opened or closed."

    "Miq" "Erin?"

    "Erin" "Oh, hi, I just-"

    "Erin" "Well, this book was so interesting. I think I lost track of time..."

    "Looking rather uncomfortable and still doubting my half-assed excuse, he decided to play along."

    "Miq" "*Sigh* Right..."

    "Miq" "Shall we go back to your home? I’ve gathered enough data about this town and its history-"

    "Erin" "Wait, wait, what about this book right here?"

    "Looking at the book, the page I’ve been staring at for the past hour had vanished, along with all of the intricate drawings, and the message behind it."

    "It was gone, replaced by a poem" ""

    "{i}Blunt scissors tore my heart{/i}
    {i}Pawn of the divine, scapegoat of the weak {/i}
    {i}Overtaken by guilt{/i}
    {i}Pierced by their hollow labor{/i}
    {i}Mirror of the soul{/i}
    {i}Yearns for the pure gesture{/i}
    {i}Shrouded in darkness{/i}
    {i}Washed, bleached of their colors{/i}"

    "Seeking meaning through words that seemed more like a magic spell, I became thoroughly disappointed."

    "Did I just imagine that? What the fuck is this? Yet another poem? This must be one of those weird coincidences, because why would someone be stalking me with poems?"

    "Confusing poems at best. They’re not even good! Like, what mystical meaning is behind all this stuff?"

    "Pulled out of my mind again by this puzzling book. I closed it and tossed it over the table in an act of primitive rage or perhaps dread. The scariest thing about that book is how it changed just before my eyes."

    "And I knew it was medieval in essence, that faded away to something even more sinister. Whatever you believe, I wasn’t prepared for a sudden change of pace regarding a book of all things."

    "Miq" "Hey, hey, big boy."

    "Miq" "No need to toss it away."

    "Erin" "Right, sorry. I just saw something scary flash before my eyes."

    "Erin" "Anyway, can we go back to the motel? My head is pounding really hard. Ah, and before that can we pass by my house on the way? I need to check some stuff."

    "Miq" "Atta boy."

    # "{b}At home{/b}"

    "My house was the loneliest just at the boundary between city and wilderness; my brother told me it’d be best here because of its elevated mound."

    "The sun bids goodbye revealing a hellish glimpse into what lays beyond death for sinners. The red ferrous dirt stained my white boots — It was like I was consumed by blood, each step leaving a murder trail behind me."

    "This town is cursed, maybe Mom should’ve never left Uberlandia over starting anew in this nowhere place."

    "A chilling sensation from seeing the sorry state of my rented house was enough evidence to back away and tell Miq we could enjoy the rest of the day together in the bed."

    "Alas, I still had to leave notes for my brother that was supposed to be back some 13 minutes ago."

    "Each step  on the porch creaked. It was in a poor state" "one plank was broken , another darkened by the passage of time and the one in front had moss all over. I reached for the door handle.... Locked, my brother must have locked me outside."

    "Erin" "... Shit..."

    "Erin" "WELL, well, well... Looks like the front door’s locked, guess that means we’re going back to the motel."

    "Miq" "Let’s be off then, it’s getting late."

    "..."

    "Miq" "So, you and your friend Namy? Are-"

    "Erin" "Nem-Mee. That’s how you should say it."

    "Miq" "Hmm, sorry. Anyway, are you two okay?"

    "Erin" "Who knows. I snapped at him, he told me off."

    "Stars twinkled, crickets sung their melody, mist turned into rain. But no matter how much background noise there was, Miq remained silent for far too long, maybe searching for words to throw away."

    "Miq" "I’m sorry."

    "Erin" "For what?"

    "Miq" "Didn’t know you and your friend were in a tough spot, I just assumed you two were buddies given the... hug."

    "I sighed."

    "Erin" "Ok, sorry for snapping at you. I’m just not used to being told off by a friend I missed for a long time."

    "Miq" "Well, I heard little of the conversation, but he was serious while you lost your composure- Oh shit, sorry."

    "Erin" "It’s ok. I just really don’t understand why he was so mean and told me off. I know I yelled at him, and came from nowhere invading his personal space and stuff... I just..."

    "..."

    "Erin" "Don’t know how things got this bad."

    "Miq" "Well, you can still fix this."

    "Erin" "How? By begging him?"

    "Miq" "Calm down, and ask yourself if you’ve been 100\% sincere with him-"

    "Erin" "But I WAS sincere."

    "Miq" "You’re doing it again. You cannot let your feelings get in the way Erin. It’s only a matter of seconds before you yell at me."

    "Erin" "... Sorry."

    "Miq" "Better. Now, you should think about it, ask yourself and none other than yourself. \'Was I avoiding him this entire time while he was living and going about his life?\'"

    "Miq" "If you notice you’re avoiding Nemmi out of pure spite, then, try to make sense of it, imagine yourself in his shoes and really try to approach him with honesty and make sure you’re there to listen to him. It’s really all we can do."

    "Miq" "You should try to apologize. Come clean, without any expectations of getting forgiven or actually mending things together. The more you expect, the less honest you are."

    "Miq" "And you should apologize for lying, or avoiding him all this time, if that really was the case."

    "..."

    "Erin" "Well, all I can say is that... I was avoiding him, but later on I wanted to see him, so I thought this was his way to retaliate against me."

    "Miq" "Really? I mean, I also did something similar with someone, and they tried their best to contact me, but I just blocked him in Talkaloo..."

    "Erin" "What’s Too-kah-loo{i}? {/i}"

    "Miq" "A messaging app similar to Bonfire, but with fewer bugs."

    "Erin" "Hm, ok."

    "Miq" "I only did that because he was also an asshole. But that’s not the case with you and Ney-may? Anyway, just think and apologize to him expecting nothing back."

    "Erin" "Aight."

    "That word lingered more than I wanted, but I wasn’t annoyed. I actually got good advice for God’s sake."

    "Yet, I couldn’t help but wonder if I was absent this whole time. My routine these past years sure was strict and I only got outside for leisure. If anything, the library books were my only joy."

    "{i}Hmm... I should think about this later.{/i}"

    "Lost"

    "We were still driving, houses vanished in the darkness, the road reduced to a thin carpet and mud."

    "Erin" "Where are we?"

    "Miq" "You tell me, don’t you live here?"

    "Erin" "Yeah, but I don’t go out at night, mostly because there’s nothing to do in this shit hole."

    "Miq" "Ok, so I’ll just back out and hope we don’t end up in the middle of the forest."

    "Each rain droplet punched the car windows, and the outside only had empty spaces where light posts once stood. They guided nocturnal rides. We were lost, completely off the grid."

    "Erin" "Any protein bars?"

    "Miq" "Not if you want to die."

    "..."

    "Miq" "Sorry, I’m not used to getting lost and having no way to get back. They’re all moldy. I bought them on the way to my dorm two weeks ago and forgot they were still there."

    "Erin" "I mean, sorry that I didn’t tell you earlier the correct way, I could’ve been more useful."

    "Miq" "No worries, now we need to get the fuck outta here."

    "A lone light post stands amidst the wilderness. It would be a comforting sight if not for the fact there was someone standing with a huge raincoat, he raised his paws for a ride."

    "I wasn’t too keen on letting a stranger join us, given our current status of lost in the middle of nowhere..."

    "Miq" "Hey look, that lad is soaking, we should help."

    "Erin" "Hmm, I’m not sure Miq, why would they be in such a strategic place?"

    "Miq" "Erin!"

    "Erin" "What?"

    "Miq" "I bet he just needs help to get back town, don’t judge a book for its cover, he could be our way out."

    "Erin" "Ok then, go on."

    "The figure had entered our car and sat on the passenger\'s seat for quite a while, we almost didn’t exchange words, Miq handled all the awkward talking between offering a ride and getting them in the car."

    "They wore a raincoat to conceal their true self, albeit we didn\'t know which species they were, but if I would place a guess, they do not have fur as his tail slithered around as he tried to hide from us."

    "..."

    "???" "Sunny day, ain’t it?"

    "Miq" "Hm? Ah, yes, it was a sunny day before, but now it’s pitch black."

    "???" "Doesn’t color me surprised. D’you guys have any tunes in the magic- I mean, radio."

    "Miq" "Oh, no signal either, and even if I got one, I don\'t think this town has a radio station for night fellas like us, it’s past midnight."

    "???" "Ah, what an unfortunate thing. Any snacks?"

    "Miq" "I had some-"

    "Erin" "Threw them away."

    "???" "Oh, I see. May I ask you boy, I think I heard you somewhere. What’s your name?"

    "Erin" "Erin."

    "Miq" "... Name’s Michael... And, what’s your sir?"

    "Bello" "Oh please, I’m not that old. My name’s Bello."

    "Miq" "Nice to meet you Bello. What were you doing in the rain alone?"

    "Bello" "Nothing noteworthy my lads. Maybe... Waiting for you two."

    "Miq" "How come?"

    "Bello" "Time is a strange thing. You remind me of an old pal of mine, instead he went down on his own and disappeared off the distance."

    "Miq" "D’you what happened to them?

    Bello"

    "Miq" "Must be really tough, but well. You know a way back to town so we can get some eye rest?"

    "I didn’t even notice, but we’re still in the same spot since the time we picked him up, I swear I thought the car was moving."

    "Bello" "To the left friends, and then you shall see the highway you came through, then the town ahead, first thing the motel and where I shall be off on my own."

    "Miq" "Wait, you don’t want us to drive you home? I’m pretty sure it\'s ok-"

    "Bello" "No, no, no. Just get me to the city and I shall take care of myself, it is known this city poses little threat at the hour of the owl."

    "Miq" "Right... Off we go."

    "..."

    "The road stretched to infinity, a never ending line of light posts lighting our way. A few couple times Miq prompted me, superficially looking for clues of how to start a conversation."

    "I thought of plans for tomorrow, to discuss with Miq the weird book I found at the town archives, and what they would get for dinner."

    "Bello" "Ah!"

    "We both jumped unprepared for the silence to be shattered by any words."

    "Bello" "I remembered what I was supposed to ask. So I remember seeing you, Erin at the library the other day."

    "Erin" "Oh, yeah, I work there.
    Splendid! I love books as much as anyone on the entire planet. I mean, I have read hundreds of books, and it’s incredible how words can be made into images and so forth."

    "Erin" "Me too, I mean, I spend most time reading fantasy books, people\'s imaginations are amazing."

    "Bello" "Very well. I’ve also dabbled in fantasy myself. But I derive joy from sci-fi, to imagine the distant future."

    "Erin" "I see."

    "To our luck, the town lights were just ahead. Miq slammed on the pedal, his hope to get some shut eye restored. At one point he told me he was starving but sleep should come first and foremost."

    "The outdoor sign of the motel soon made itself visible. Relief washed over both of us as the fatigue was getting to Miq."

    "Miq" "Here we are! And... Bellos, are you 100\% you don’t need a ride home?"

    "Bellos" "Nope. I just need to say one last thing before I’m off on my own."

    "He leaned in his seat and spoke into my ears with a silky voice. I didn’t know why, but he whispered to me with a rather enthusiastic tone."

    "Bellos" "Hydrargyrum, now I know you’re in good paws. We’ll meet each other again. Now be off to sleep."

    "He exited the car and Miq drove off nonchalantly, desperate to get to our bedroom. Those words invaded my mind and wrecked everything. I never met him, I’ve never been called that."

    "Or have I?"

    "I didn’t know, and the fact he knew something ominous and said I was in good paws... What does all of that mean? "

    "Time advanced but I was shocked... Too stunned to even speak, walk or sleep. Everything was reduced to a blurred memory of Miq carrying me, helping me lay down and tucking me in; perhaps I got drunk with Miq on the way and the rest was lost to the night."
