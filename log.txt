    "Hypnotized by my erection, all other things he planned for that morning slowly melted away, like butter on a hot pan.  All I could do was stare and think of how to treat myself accordingly."

    Then Nemmi came into action. He knew how much I suffered at the paws of those school bullies, having my tail pulled and my ears pulled as if to tear them apart. Nemmi put a halt to that, and he tightly held my paw that day. I felt strong by his side; he’d always keep me safe.

    e It’s ok Nemmi.
